# GroovyEngine
Game engine with editor, currently in development, important stuff missing like physics.

# How to build
The engine was built from the ground up with cross platform support in mind, but it currently runs only on Windows.
To build the Visual Studio 2022 solution just run "GenWinProjects.bat", open the .sln file, build and run!

# Cool stuff
- C++ reflection and serialization (inspired by Unreal)

# Libs used
- Dear ImGui
- stbi
