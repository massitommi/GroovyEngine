# GroovyEngine
Game engine with editor

# How to build
Even though this engine was built with cross platform support in mind, currently it runs only on windows.
To build the Visual Studio 2022 solution for windows just run "GenWinProjects.bat". Then launch!

# Cool stuff
- C++ reflection and serialization (inspired by unreal)
